Urban heat is a growing concern, particularly in dense metropolitan areas where
high temperatures increase the risk of heat-related illness and drive energy
expenses for cooling. Estimating the effects of urban heat remains a challenge
due to limitations in describing the built environment, computational
constraints, and the need for high-resolution data. This software presents
open-source, computationally efficient machine learning methods that enhance
the accuracy of urban temperature estimates compared to historical reanalysis
data. Models trained using this software have been applied to urban
microclimates in Los Angeles and Seattle showing greater accuracy and less bias
when compared to low-resolution reanalysis datasets like ERA5 and even when
compared to high-resolution mesoscale numerical weather models like WRF with an
urban canopy model. Initial findings highlight how machine learning can support
urban heat resilience planning by enabling improved assessments of local heat
islands, mitigation strategies, and their energy implications.
