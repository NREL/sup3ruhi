Welcome to Sup3rUHI!
====================

The Sup3rUHI software uses generative adversarial networks to add synthetic
high-resolution temperature fields with urban heat island (UHI) effects to
low-resolution reanalysis data (e.g., ERA5). This software is an extension of
`(sup3r) <https://nrel.github.io/sup3r>`__.
